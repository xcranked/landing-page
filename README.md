# landing-page
Project: Landing Page apart of "https://www.theodinproject.com"s Foundations Course.


During this project I successfully employed my new learned skills of:

    *Creating a full html page without external resources
    *Creating my very first CSS, with minor help from external resources and the Foundations course
    *Enhanced my linux command knowledge, quickly able to execute commands

Please feel free to message me on discord @xcranked if you have any suggestions for improving my code.
